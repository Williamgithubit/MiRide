- [ ] Color contrast meets standards

### **Error Handling Tests**

#### ‚úÖ Network Errors
- [ ] API timeout handling
- [ ] Network disconnection handling
- [ ] Server error responses (500, 404, etc.)
- [ ] Invalid data handling
- [ ] Authentication expiry handling

#### ‚úÖ User Input Validation
- [ ] Empty reason rejection handling
- [ ] Invalid booking ID handling
- [ ] Concurrent action prevention (disable buttons during loading)

## üöÄ Manual Testing Steps

### **Setup Test Data**
1. Ensure you have test bookings with `pending_approval` status
2. Ensure bookings have proper car and customer associations
3. Test with different booking statuses

### **Test Scenarios**

#### **Scenario 1: View Booking Requests**
1. Navigate to Owner Dashboard ‚Üí Booking Requests
2. Verify table loads with booking data
3. Test search functionality with customer names
4. Test status filtering
5. Test pagination if multiple bookings exist

#### **Scenario 2: Approve Booking**
1. Click "Approve" button on a pending booking
2. Verify approval modal opens with correct booking details
3. Click "Approve Booking" button
4. Verify success toast appears
5. Verify booking status updates in table
6. Verify customer receives notification

#### **Scenario 3: Reject Booking**
1. Click "Reject" button on a pending booking
2. Verify rejection modal opens
3. Select a predefined reason
4. Click "Reject Booking" button
5. Verify success toast appears
6. Verify booking status updates in table
7. Test custom reason input

#### **Scenario 4: View Booking Details**
1. Click "View" button on any booking
2. Verify details modal opens with complete information
3. Verify all sections display correctly
4. Test modal close functionality

#### **Scenario 5: Responsive Design**
1. Test on mobile device/browser dev tools
2. Verify mobile card layout works
3. Test touch interactions
4. Verify all functionality works on mobile

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Import Path Issues**
- Ensure BookingStatusBadge import path is correct
- Verify React Icons are properly imported

### **API Integration Issues**
- Check server is running and accessible
- Verify authentication tokens are valid
- Check network tab for API call errors

### **State Management Issues**
- Verify Redux store is properly configured
- Check for cache invalidation after mutations
- Ensure proper error handling in RTK Query

### **Styling Issues**
- Verify Tailwind CSS is properly configured
- Check for dark mode class conflicts
- Ensure responsive classes are applied correctly

## üìä Performance Considerations

- [ ] Table pagination prevents performance issues with large datasets
- [ ] Image lazy loading for car images
- [ ] Debounced search to prevent excessive API calls
- [ ] Proper memoization in React components
- [ ] Efficient Redux selectors

## üîí Security Considerations

- [ ] Owner can only see/manage their own car bookings
- [ ] Proper authentication on all API endpoints
- [ ] Input sanitization for rejection reasons
- [ ] CSRF protection on mutation endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints
